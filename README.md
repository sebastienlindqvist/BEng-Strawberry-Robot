# BEng-Strawberry-Robot

- The Strawberry Picking Robot was my final year Bachelor project. This was a self proposed project because I wanted to used as much of my broad knowledge as possible.
It went through many design considerations such as whether or not it should be a 6 axis arm, SCARA or a H bot. In the end I decided going with a H bot and it went through many design iterations

## Nueral Network & Computer Vision
- At first I wanted to use a nueral network to detect the strawberries however, I could not find any pretrained nueral networks at the time. As this was during winter, I could not take images myself in the correct enviroment as well as the time to classify the images correctly.

- This resulted in me having to use simple computer vision using OpenCV to detect red and find edges to find each strawberry. With that I can use that the pixel coordinates of the center of each to get depth from the depth camera.
### Computer Vision
- OpenCV was very easy to install on my main computer I was coding on. When it came to installing the latest version of OpenCV for python on the raspberry pi that was controlling the robot. It did hit some snags as in installing an older version and code had to be slightly altered.
