# BEng-Strawberry-Robot

the Strawberry Picking Robot was my final year Bachelor project. This was a self proposed project because I wanted to used as much of my broad knowledge as possible.
It went through many design considerations such as whether or not it should be a 6 axis arm, SCARA or a H bot. In the end I decided going with a H bot and it went through many design iterations
